Smart AdServer - Google Mobile Ads SDK Adapter
==============================================

Introduction
------------
The _Smart Display SDK_ can be used through _Google Mobile Ads_ using the adapter provided in this repository for banners, interstitial and native ads. Those adapters are compatible with the _Smart Display SDK_ v7.0.

Setup
-----

1) Install the _Google Mobile Ads SDK_ according to the official documentation https://developers.google.com/admob/android/sdk.

2) Install the _Smart Display SDK_ by adding the ```smart-display-sdk``` dependency to your _gradle_ file (more info in [the documentation](https://documentation.smartadserver.com/displaySDK/android/gettingstarted.html)).

3) Checkout this repository and copy the _Custom event classes_ you need into your Android project:

* ```SASGMACustomEventBanner``` for banners.
* ```SASGMACustomEventInterstitial``` for interstitials.
* ```SASGMACustomEventNative``` for native ads.
* ```SASGMACustomEventBase``` in any case.

4) Only for _Smart Display SDK_ version < v7.6, edit the ```SASGMACustomEventBase``` class and change the `SMART_BASE_URL` value with the domain assigned to your Smart's Manage Network.

5) In your Google Ad Mob or Google Ad Manager interface, depending on which tool you use, you will need to setup a mediation group and add a custom event as an 'ad source' that will be activated on ad units of your application.

Typically, to deliver Smart ads on a Google ad unit, you need to create a custom event with :

* the _Class Name_ field: set `com.smartadserver.android.library.mediation.SASGMACustomEventBanner` for banners, `com.smartadserver.android.library.mediation.SASGMACustomEventInterstitial` for interstitials and `com.smartadserver.android.library.mediation.SASGMACustomEventNative` for native ads
* the _Parameter_ (optional) field: set your _Smart AdServer_ IDs concatenated as a string using slash separator `[siteID]/[pageID]/[formatID]`
